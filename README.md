# Heart Disease Risk Prediction with PyTorch, ANN & Gradio
This project builds and deploys an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch to predict heart disease risk based on clinical features. The model is trained on the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset from Kaggle and deployed using Gradio for interactive predictions.

# Dependencies
pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn torch gradio

# Features
Binary classification model (heart disease: Yes or No)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
Data preprocessing: encoding, scaling, splitting
ANN built from scratch using PyTorch
Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, F1-Score
Deployed via Gradio web interface
Dataset
*Source:* Heart Failure Prediction Dataset on Kaggle

*Target Variable*: HeartDisease (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

*Features:* Age, Sex, ChestPainType, RestingBP, Cholesterol, MaxHR, Fasting BS, RestingECG, MaxHR, ExerciseAngina, Oldpeak, ST_Slope.
